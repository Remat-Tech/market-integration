"""
Business-rule validation for market data ticks.

Pydantic's `MarketData` model already enforces structural rules (types,
positive prices, non-negative volumes, ...) at construction time -- a
tick that violates those never even becomes a MarketData object. This
module adds the cross-field business rules the schema can't express on
its own: relationships between fields (bid < ask, price within the
day's range) and freshness (the tick isn't stale or timestamped in the
future).

`validate_tick` is a plain, dependency-free function on purpose: it is
called independently by more than one downstream branch off the buffer
(a real-time ValidatingStream here, and the aggregator's own filtering
in app.aggregation.market_aggregator). Neither branch depends on the
other, so a slow/backed-up database write can never delay real-time
delivery, and vice versa.

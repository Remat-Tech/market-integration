"""
Async buffer/broadcaster sitting between a market data connector's live
stream and the downstream consumers (processor, gateway, Symphony
delivery, ...).

Supports any number of independent subscribers, each in one of two modes:

  * subscribe()          -- ordered replay. A bounded per-subscriber FIFO
                             of raw ticks (all symbols interleaved in
                             arrival order). If the subscriber falls
                             behind and the queue fills up, the oldest
                             buffered tick is dropped to make room. This
                             preserves ordering and every symbol gets a
                             fair share of the buffer, but under
                             sustained backpressure a slow consumer can
                             still miss whole rounds for some symbols --
                             the drop is chronological, not per-symbol.

  * subscribe_latest()    -- conflated. Only the single most recent tick
                             per symbol is kept per subscriber; a new
                             tick for a symbol overwrites any unread one
                             for that same symbol instead of queueing
                             behind it. A slow consumer never falls
                             permanently behind and never misses a
                             symbol -- it just always catches up to the
                             current price for each one. This is the
                             right mode for anything that only cares
                             about "what's the price right now" (a
                             gateway/dashboard), as opposed to
                             "processor" reads if it needs to see every
                             tick, use subscribe() instead.

Usage:

    connector = MockMarketConnector(symbols=["AAPL", "TSLA"])
    await connector.connect()

    buffer = MarketDataBuffer(connector.stream(), maxsize=200)
    await buffer.start()

    processor_feed = buffer.subscribe("processor")        # every tick
    gateway_feed = buffer.subscribe_latest("gateway")      # latest per symbol

    async for tick in gateway_feed:
        ...

    await buffer.stop()

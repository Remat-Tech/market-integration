"""
Canonical market data shape used everywhere downstream of a connector.

Every connector (mock or real) is responsible for normalizing whatever
format its provider uses into this shape. Nothing outside of connectors/
should ever need to know a provider's raw field names.

Beyond the core tick (symbol, price, volume, timestamp), this also carries
the fundamentals a quote page needs (previous close, day/52-week range,
market cap, bid/ask, dividend info, ...). None of that exists in a real
GSE entitlement yet, so the mock connector fills it with generated
placeholder values -- see app/connectors/market_connector.py.
